I am 47 years old
The time has finally come to take up a business that has been interesting all my life, but for which there was no time between raising children, now grandchildren), work, home.
There is no programming experience, if you do not take into account the update 1C and computer science at school on Intel II.This resume is my first job in programming
I am a teacher by training, but I have worked as an accountant all my life. Self-education is my best quality. I am constantly learning.
English, to my regret, somewhere at the zero level. In a previous life, these skills were not needed. This is something that still needs to be mastered.
